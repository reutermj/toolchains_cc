# Package format: <host>-<target>-binutils-<version>-<datetime>.tar.xz

#
# Why include host in the package name?
# In future tasks, we will build cross-compiling toolchains (e.g., binutils
# running on x86_64 but targeting aarch64). The host architecture identifies
# where the toolchain binaries will run. Since binaries are statically linked,
# we use a simplified format (x86_64-linux) that works across any Linux distro.
#
# Why include datetime in release names?
# toolchains_cc must preserve functionality of previous releases, which means
# using the same version of toolchain binaries that were used in those releases.
# Adding datetime allows us to update/rebuild toolchain artifacts while
# maintaining existing artifacts for backward compatibility.
