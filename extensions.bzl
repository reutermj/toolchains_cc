# Why are we using a module extension + two repo rules?
# toolchains_cc should only download the toolchain binaries for the toolchain that is actually used. For example, a user
# might want to have a polyglot repo with both C and Python code, and when they're just building the Python code,
# toolchains_cc shouldn't block the user by performing the expensive binary downloads. If only one repo rule was used
# to both declare the toolchain and download the toolchain binaries, then it would be impossible to register the
# toolchain without also downloading the binaries. This problem is solved by using two repo rules: one to declare the
# toolchain and another to download the toolchain binaries. The first is eagerly fetched when the toolchain is
# registered, and the second is fetched only when the toolchain is actually used to compile C/C++ code. The module
# extension must be used here because a repo rule isn't allowed to invoke another repo rule.
